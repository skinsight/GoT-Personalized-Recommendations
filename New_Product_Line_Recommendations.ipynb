    "\n",
    "For this marketing study, I have created fictional sales data for an imaginary beauty company called \"Game of Tones.\" This company offers a collection of skincare products and color cosmetics inspired by HBO's hit series \"Game of Thrones.\" All customers listed in the raw data are named after \"Game of Thrones\" characters for educational purposes only, not for commercial purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, one customer named Daenerys Targaryen bought Dragon Fire Foundation on January 1, 2019 (20190101). All product sales data is stored in the following csv file: GoT_Sales_Stats_Fictional.csv. You can open this file using Excel, Google Sheets, or various text editors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data, the GoTones team wants to launch a more effective marketing strategy that will reward loyal customers by offering a personalized gift with purchase. They don't want the promotion, however, to result in a temporary hit on primary sales of frequently-purchased products.\n",
    "\n",
    "My solution is the following: \n",
    "- For each product, find a newly-launched product that is most similar and can enhance the effects of the frequently-purchased product. This information is stored in a separate csv file, Comparable_Complimentary_Products.csv.\n",
    "- Send this newly-launched product as the customized complimentary gift to each individual customer in its database. \n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that the above strategy will increase brand loyalty, client retention and, at the same time, keep revenue consistent. This strategy also has the potential to introduce customers to the newborn products and therefore generate future sales of these new products which have not yet had time to develop a following. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project is my attempt to show ways in which cosmetic companies can leverage data to create individually-targeted, customer-centric marketing campaigns. My goal is for each customer to receive a meaningful, relevant gift with purchase, which, in turn, will increase brand loyalty and customer retention. I also hope to demonstrate that there are ways to reward loyal customers without causing a temporary fluctuation in revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that I have taken inspiration from HBO's \"Game of Thrones\" and generated this imaginary data for educational purposes only, not for commercial purposes. \n",
